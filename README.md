## Abstract

## Planned Deliverables
We are aiming to create a webapp finally to classify the genre and identify the sentiments of a song. The webapp will be able to classify the genre and sentiments of a song by reviewing the lyrics. A classification model would be trained by us and implemented to the webapp.

If we achieve full success, the webapp will have a nice interface for the users to input the lyrics of the songs to be analyzed, and through our trained model, the webapp will classify the genre and analyze the sentiments. If we achieve partial success, the model would be generated and there would be a blog post and code repository detailing our machine learning pipeline, which would offer hints and support for further improvement of the model and the development of the webapp. 

The interface would be a form based one. To be specific, the interface would include a text area for the users to input the lyrics. Furthermore, the output would present the genre and sentiment identification result analyzed from the lyrics.

## Resources Required

## Tools and Skills Required

Machine learning is the fundamental tool for our project since our classification of genre and sentiments bases on the training datasets. Also, as our potential dataset consists of different additional information such as time period, artist, producer, etc., we need to manage the database before proceeding with the data analysis. Our final webapp also requires interactive graphics and graphical user interface that allows users to input songs, so we need skills in web development. We would like to utilize Python packages such as Django and Tkinter. Libraries that we have learned in class, for example, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, and Matplotlib are also expected for filtering the data and generating plots.

## What You Will Learn

## Risks

One risk is that we possibly could not find soundwaves data of songs or we do not have enough computational power to analyze soundwaves and therefore couldnâ€™t incorporate such a factor to our genre classification. The other risk is that some songs that we adopt as the dataset may be subject to copyright issues.


## Ethics

## Tentative Schedule
1. After two weeks, we hope to have a cleaned dataset ready for our model, as well as have learned the basics of natural language processing. 
2. After four weeks, we hope to have chosen a classification model and have a minimum viable product. 
3. After six weeks, we hope to have fine tuned our model and have created a webapp, as well as explore songs in other languages.
