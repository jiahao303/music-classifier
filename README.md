## Abstract

## Planned Deliverables

## Resources Required

## Tools and Skills Required

Machine learning is the fundamental tool for our project since our classification of genre and sentiments bases on the training datasets. Also, as our potential dataset consists of different additional information such as time period, artist, producer, etc., we need to manage the database before proceeding with the data analysis. Our final webapp also requires interactive graphics and graphical user interface that allows users to input songs, so we need skills in web development. We would like to utilize Python packages such as Django and Tkinter. Libraries that we have learned in class, for example, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, and Matplotlib are also expected for filtering the data and generating plots.

## What You Will Learn

## Tentative Schedule
1. After two weeks, we hope to have a cleaned dataset ready for our model, as well as have learned the basics of natural language processing. 
2. After four weeks, we hope to have chosen a classification model and have a minimum viable product. 
3. After six weeks, we hope to have fine tuned our model and have created a webapp, as well as explore songs in other languages.
